**About the code**

This code was used to introduce the first concepts in JavaScript as variables, conditionals, operators, loop loops, and functions.
Through this code you can find out in practice how JavaScript works and get started with the language.

**What is JavaScript?**

If you work with web development, knowledge of JavaScript is required. This is the programming language that runs in 100% of browsers, and is therefore present in virtually all online projects.

With JavaScript you are able to control all the behavior of your application in the browser, taking the user experience to the next level and making your interface totally dynamic.

Besides being essential in web development, JavaScript has been widely used in mobile development, both through hybrid tools like Ionic and more modern technologies like React Native.

With React Native you can even develop native apps for iOS and Android and manipulate all smartphone features like GPS, camera, files, contacts, directly with JavaScript.

And for all that JavaScript is the most popular programming language on the web and has the largest community, as well as being one of the most modern and evolving faster, being applied in robotics, desktop, mobile and even machine learning.
